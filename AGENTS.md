## Automated Agent Instructions

### Directory and File Handling

- In the `custom_components/polleninformation/translations/` directory, only edit the `en.json` file for content changes (new strings, rewording, etc.). Mechanical changes required for validation compliance (e.g. HACS rules) may be applied across all translation files.

### Coding Principles

- All code must follow the KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.

### Comments and Documentation

- All code should be commented for clarity.
- All documentation, including comments, must be written in English.
